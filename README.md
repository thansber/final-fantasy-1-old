Final Fantasy 1 Web Application
===============================

I have been playing the original Final Fantasy for the NES for years now, and I have been very interested in the
mechanics behind the game.  Luckily, several people have decoded the raw data and formulas used to power the game
so nearly everything about the game is now widely available.

I have been doing smaller side projects around FF for awhile, and decided to see if I could re-create the entire
game experience as an HTML5 web application.  I started doing this while bored at work and wanting to play around
with Javascript/jQuery back in 2010.  If I ever finish and put this up on the web, I am pretty sure it will be illegal
since Square is still trying to make money off of this game.  Whatever.  At this rate I won't finish anytime soon. 

If you want to use any of my code for your own nefarious purposes, go right ahead.
