- handle FEAR, WARP, EXIT spells
- refactor walk/slide animations with CSS transitions/animations
    - animation for walk, class toggling
- use absolute in map config (may still need tile coords for world map encounters)
- creating cursors, other key setup uses chaining setter methods

BATTLE
======
- monster skills causing status prob need messages
- casting a spell that cannot be cast in battle should not be allowed (added spell.inBattle)
- running away for enemies
- chars w/o magic still show magic selection, when spell is selected, show desc "Nothing", wait for button to hide
- monster attack causing petrification does damage as well?

MENU
====
- cast spells outside of battle flow (healing spells)
- use consumable flow
- character sprites should have no black, it should all be transparent
- what statuses do we show in char menu, sprites 

TOWNS
=====
- when selling equipment, do prices disappear?
- need oasis shop flow, cursor, npc sprite
- show descs when selecting key items in inventory

- what happens to stoned chars when in clinic?
- what statuses does an inn stay heal?
- add "door" transitions for use in castles/dungeons
- encode castles (Coneria/Elfland)
- CSS transitions in town to leave and to enter shops
- pressing Enter/Space in town displays message
- add people in town initially not moving
- add NPC object to track initial position, sprite, and conversations

- make transitions use 3-tiered map > map -- y coord -- x coord for faster lookups
