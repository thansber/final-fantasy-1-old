- fix HARM spells so they only work on undead

- monster skills causing status prob need messages
- figure out what happens to a char when they are asleep

- add images for critical/normal chars backwards for running away sprites
- running away for enemies

- chars w/o magic still show magic selection, when spell is selected, show desc "Nothing", wait for button to hide
