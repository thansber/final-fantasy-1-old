- handle FEAR, WARP, EXIT spells

BATTLE
======
- monster skills causing status prob need messages
- casting a spell that cannot be cast in battle should not be allowed (added spell.inBattle)
- running away for enemies
- chars w/o magic still show magic selection, when spell is selected, show desc "Nothing", wait for button to hide
- monster attack causing petrification does damage as well?
- too long of a pause when monster casts spell that kills char?
- drink command
- item command
- wait for button after displaying Monsters perished
- wait for button after displaying rewards
- level ups
- splash builds 3 items, then moves them around, then hides them at the end
	- creep = 45 
	- imp = 18
	- madpony = 24
	- garland = 45
- char flicker - char goes dark 4 times
- The black ORB
glitters ominously....
But nothing happens.
